DESCRIPTION:
The code leverages Java's  and  classes for network communication and multithreading to handle multiple users simultaneously. By using threads, the server can communicate with multiple clients, ensuring real-time interaction. This is ideal for applications such as group chats or collaborative environments where users need to send and receive messages concurrently
This Java program demonstrates the basics of a client-server model for chat applications. It combines simplicity with functionality, making it a solid foundation for building more advanced features like encryption, user interfaces, or integration with databases. With further enhancements, the application could easily evolve into a robust platform for real-time communication.
